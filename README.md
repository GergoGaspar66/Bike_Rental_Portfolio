Citi Bike ETL Project
Overview

  This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL process for Citi Bike trip data. I cleaned raw CSVs, transformed the data, and loaded it into a PostgreSQL database with analytical    views for reporting.

Key Features:

  Data Cleaning & Transformation: handled duplicates, missing values, anomalous trip durations, and standardized columns.
  
  Database Design: created stations, users, gender, dim_date, and trip_informations tables with proper keys.
  
  Analytical Views: bike_usage, user_trip_stats, station_usage, trip_summary, and daily_trip_summary.
  
  ETL Automation: Python scripts using pandas and psycopg2 for bulk insertion.

Skills Demonstrated:

  Python, pandas, SQL, PostgreSQL, data cleaning, ETL, data modeling, and analytical reporting.
